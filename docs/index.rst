PyZMQ is the Python bindings for ØMQ_, written almost entirely in Cython_. This
documentation currently contains notes on some important aspects of developing PyZMQ and
an overview of what the ØMQ API looks like in Python. For information on how to use
ØMQ in general, see the excellent `ØMQ Manual`_.

Please don't hesitate to report pyzmq issues to our tracker_ on GitHub.
