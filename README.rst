==============================
PyZMQ: Python bindings for 0MQ
==============================

This package contains Python bindings for `0MQ <http://www.zeromq.org>`_.
0MQ is a lightweight and fast messaging implementation.

Versioning
==========

Current development version of pyzmq is 2.1.1, and targets zeromq master. For zeromq
2.0.10 or `maint` branch, use pyzmq release 2.0.10 or the 2.0.x development branch.

PyZMQ versioning follows 0MQ versioning. In general, your pyzmq version should be the same
as that of your zeromq, but due to the generally growing API of zeromq, your pyzmq should
*not* be newer than your zeromq. This is a strict restriction for pyzmq <= 2.1.0, but we
intend to support zeromq >= 2.1.0 for pyzmq 2.1.x.

Documentation
=============

See PyZMQ's Sphinx `generated documentation <http://zeromq.github.com/pyzmq>`_ on GitHub for API details, and some notes on Python and Cython development.

Downloading
===========

Unless you specifically want to develop PyZMQ, we recommend downloading the
PyZMQ source code from our github download page here:

https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/downloads

While you can also get the latest source code by forking our github
repository, building from the repository will require that you download and
install Cython version 0.13 or later.

Building and installation
=========================

General
-------

To build and install this Python package, you will first need to build and
install the latest development version of 0MQ itself. After you have done
this, follow these steps:

First, copy the ``setup.cfg.template`` file in this directory to ``setup.cfg``
and edit the `include_dirs` and `library_dirs` fields of the ``setup.cfg``
file to point to the directories that contain the library and header file for
your 0MQ installation.

Second, run this command::

    $ python setup.py install

Cython is not required to build pyzmq from a release package, but it is
required if you want to develop pyzmq, or build directly from our repository
on GitHub.

Windows
-------

Generally you'll need to add the location of ``libzmq.dll`` to your ``$PATH``.
Here's Microsoft's docs:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d83bc18(VS.80).aspx on this topic.

It is best to compile both ØMQ and PyØMQ with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or
above. You should not need to use mingw.

Linux
-----

On Linux, you will need to do one of the following:

* Set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to point to the ``lib`` directory of 0MQ.
* Build the extension using the ``-rpath`` flag::

    $ python setup.py build_ext --rpath=/opt/zeromq-dev/lib --inplace

Development
-----------

To develop PyZMQ, you will need to install Cython, version 0.13 or greater.
After installing Cython, instead of doing ``python setup.py install`` do::

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    $ python setupegg.py develop

This will build the C extension inplace and then put this directory on your
``sys.path``. With this configuration you only have to run::

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

each time you change the ``.pyx`` files. To clean the sources, you can do::

    $ python setup.py clean

Testing
-------

To run the test suite after installing, just do::

    $ python setup.py test

How to release PyZMQ
--------------------

Currently, we are using the following steps to release PyZMQ:

* Change the version number in ``version.pyx``.
* Remove old ``MANIFEST`` and ``egg-info`` files and ``dist`` and ``build``
  directories.
* Check ``MANIFEST.in``.
* Register the release with pypi::

    python setup.py register

* Build source distributions and upload::

    python setup.py sdist --formats=zip,gztar upload

* Upload the tarball and ``.zip`` file to github.
* Branch the release::

    git co -b 2.0.8 master
    git push origin 2.0.8

* Tag the release::

    git tag -a -m “Tagging release 2.0.8” 2.0.8
    git push origin —tags

* Make sure the ``README.rst`` has an updated list of contributors.
* Announce on list.
